# Beginner's Deep Learning Playground

A collection of small, beginner-friendly deep learning projects to help anyone start their journey into AI and neural networks. Each project is thoroughly documented and written with clarity to make complex concepts accessible.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository serves as both my personal learning journey and a resource for others starting out in deep learning. Each project focuses on a specific concept or technique, implemented in a way that prioritizes understandability over optimization.

## 🧠 Projects

Each project folder contains:
- Well-commented Python code (Most the time in Jupyter Notebook)
- Step-by-step explanations of concepts
- Visualizations where helpful
- Requirements and setup instructions
- Suggested modifications to extend your learning

## 📚 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies (see individual project Requirements)
3. Explore the projects in any order - each is designed to be self-contained
4. Experiment by modifying the code and observing the results

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Familiarity with NumPy is helpful ( other libraries will be used on some projects )
- Curiosity and patience!

## 📋 Project List

- **Project 1** ---> MNIST Digit Classifier Using NN
- **Project 2** ---> MNIST Digit Classifier Using CNN
(more comming  soon)

## 🤝 Contributing
